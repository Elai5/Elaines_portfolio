                From mentoring future innovators to creating impactful designs and solutions, here’s how I’ve grown and
                contributed beyond writing code.

                <p>
                    During my time at the Google Club at Moi University, I participated in a hackathon to build a
                    portfolio website in just one day.
                    This design, which earned me second place, was celebrated for its creativity and responsiveness.
                    I learned how to craft clean layouts under tight deadlines while ensuring accessibility and user
                    experience.

                <h3>Inspiring Young Minds with Project Digital Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    While volunteering with the <strong>Project Digital Impact Foundation</strong>, I designed a simple
                    interface to teach kids how to interact with computers.
                    My focus was on creating an intuitive and visually engaging layout that made learning fun and
                    memorable.
                    Sharing this knowledge with over five schools remains one of my most fulfilling achievements.

                <p>
                    For <strong>Codejika</strong>, I not only taught secondary school students HTML and CSS but also
                    showed them how to design modern layouts.
                    Here’s an example of a simple yet effective landing page we created together during a session.
                    Watching their excitement as their designs came to life inspired me to always push for creative,
                    user-friendly designs.

                <h3>Solving Real-World Problems with Web Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Automation is a core part of my skill set. This screenshot showcases a workflow I automated for
                    scraping data from a website and populating it into a database.
                    The clean, minimal interface was designed to simplify tracking and monitoring progress. Automating
                    tasks like this not only saves time but also demonstrates how design meets functionality.
