            <h3>Where Passion Meets Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                My journey goes beyond just writing code—it's about creating a lasting impact. From mentoring young
                minds in
                web development to automating workflows that solve real-world problems, here’s how I’ve grown and
                contributed
                to the tech community.

                <p>
                    During my time at the Google Club at Moi University, I participated in a hackathon to build a
                    <Strong>portfolio website</Strong> in just one day. This design, which earned me second place, was
                    celebrated for its
                    <strong>creativity and responsiveness</strong>. It taught me how to craft clean layouts under tight
                    deadlines while
                    prioritizing accessibility and user experience.

                <p>
                    Volunteering with the <strong>Project Digital Impact Foundation</strong> allowed me to teach kids
                    basic
                    computer skills, creating a simple, engaging interface to help them learn. Designing layouts that
                    fostered both creativity and ease of use remains one of my proudest achievements, and I had the
                    chance to
                    share it with over five schools.

                <h3>Building Websites with Codejika</h3>
                <p>
                    At <strong>Codejika</strong>, I taught secondary school students HTML and CSS and showed them how to
                    design<strong>
                        modern, user-friendly websites</strong>. One memorable project was creating a landing page with
                    them—watching
                    their
                    excitement as their designs came to life was inspiring. It reaffirmed my passion for teaching and
                    design.

                <h3>Solving Real-World Problems with Web Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    Automation is a core part of my skill set. This screenshot showcases a workflow I automated for
                    scraping
                    data from a website and populating it into a database. The clean, minimal interface was designed to
                    simplify tracking and monitoring progress. Tasks like this save time and showcase how design and
                    functionality work hand in hand.

                <p>
                    As an executive member of the Toastmasters Club, I played a vital role in nurturing the art of
                    <strong>public speaking and effective communication.</strong>
                    My contributions included helping the club grow to over 50 members, successfully launching the club,
                    and officially registering it.
                    This experience taught me the importance of leadership, teamwork, and fostering a supportive
                    environment for members to develop and thrive.
                    The club’s mission aligned with my passion for empowering individuals to become confident and
                    articulate speakers.
